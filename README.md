# Machine-learning-algorithms
This contains codes for algorithms used in machine learning.

MyLinearreg contains the code for Linear regression with gradient descent method to find the coefficients. 

Mylogisticreg2 contains the code for logistic regression.
It contains gradient descent method for finding the coefficients as well.

MultiGaussclassify contains the code for Multi-Gaussian classification. This code gives the gauss distribution the input values follow.

Traintestsplit is the code for splitting any matrix X into trainset and test set according to the input ratio "pi".

Crossvalidation is the code for cross validation for the number of partitions "k".

All the codes require the basic data as a numpy matrix, X and target as numpy matrix, y.
